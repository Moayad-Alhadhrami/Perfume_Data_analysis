Elysian Perfumery is a Luxury fictional company that deals in the production and sales of luxury perfumes.

So I searched the internet for a dataset on perfume brands, whether real or fictional, but I couldnâ€™t see exactly
what I was looking for. so I took data from someone who created their own dataset with the help of Python and 
the library package random generator.

Stick with me as I walk you through the process I have undertaken from creating the dataset which has a shape 
of about (200000, 18). That is, 200000 rows and 18 columns to clean and preprocess the data and then finally 
conduct exploratory data analysis.
